<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's work transitioned from initial feature integration to extensive bug resolution and performance optimization. Initially, the focus was on advanced features like service selection, conflict detection, and itinerary editing, which involved creating new backend agents, API endpoints, and corresponding frontend UI components and handlers. Significant effort was then directed towards debugging: resolving backend agent initialization errors, fixing CORS issues for image loading, addressing dynamic pricing UI visibility, and rectifying persona classification failures due to schema mismatches. New features like an image proxy, dynamic pricing, a Request Callback modal, and trip history functionality were also introduced. The engineer iteratively refined LLM prompts and implemented concurrent agent execution for performance. The work culminated in addressing persistent image display issues and initiating a comprehensive API performance optimization strategy, which remains the immediate focus.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on optimizing API performance to achieve a sub-10-second response time target. This followed a user request for performance improvements across backend and LLM responses. The work involved:
1.  **Parallel Agent Execution Optimization**: The  was modified to execute adventurer, balanced, and luxury itinerary agents concurrently using  to reduce overall wait time. Helper functions were also added to support this.
2.  **Optimize Agent Prompts for Faster LLM Response**: The engineer had just started this sub-task, aiming to simplify and modularize prompts to minimize token usage and maximize output efficiency across the agents. The last action was specifically initiating this prompt optimization.
This is part of a broader performance strategy that also includes model optimization, caching, timeout handling, and progressive loading. The core objective is to ensure that the complex LLM-based itinerary generation and other API calls meet user experience standards.
