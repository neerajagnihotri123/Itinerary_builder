# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

However, frontend handleSendMessage function is completely broken - NO API requests are sent when send button is clicked. Network monitoring shows 0 API calls made. This explains user's exact complaint: system shows 'When would you like to travel?' instead of hotel cards because messages never reach backend. Frontend chat input/send button UI works but underlying JavaScript functionality is non-functional. URGENT: Fix handleSendMessage function in App.js to restore chat functionality."

    message: "‚ùå CRITICAL ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED - REACT APP NOT INITIALIZING: Comprehensive Playwright debugging reveals the fundamental issue: React application is NOT executing JavaScript properly in the browser. Evidence: 1) Input field accepts text ‚úÖ 2) Send button clickable ‚úÖ 3) Input NOT cleared after send click ‚ùå 4) ZERO console logs captured ‚ùå 5) ZERO network requests made ‚ùå 6) React, axios, environment variables all undefined in browser ‚ùå. Frontend service shows 'Compiled successfully!' but JavaScript bundle fails to execute. This is NOT a handleSendMessage logic issue - it's a React app initialization failure. The entire frontend JavaScript functionality is broken, preventing any chat interactions from working. Backend API confirmed working via curl (returns proper hotel cards for 'hotels on goa'). URGENT: Fix React app initialization/JavaScript bundle execution."
