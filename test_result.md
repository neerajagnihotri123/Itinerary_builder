    message: "✅ CRITICAL LLM INTEGRATION TESTS PASSED: All 3 core scenarios from review request working correctly. JSON parsing handles markdown-wrapped responses, intent analysis differentiates message types properly, LLM generates dynamic contextual responses with appropriate UI actions and follow-up questions. Destination extraction working for trip planning. Minor: Health check endpoint not available at root URL but this doesn't affect core functionality."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "✅ RE-VERIFICATION COMPLETE: All specific scenarios from review request tested and working perfectly. 1) General greeting 'Hello, how are you?' correctly classified as 'general' with NO trip planner trigger. 2) Trip planning 'I want to plan a trip to Goa' correctly triggers trip_planner_card with Goa extraction. 3) General question 'What can you do?' correctly classified as 'general' with appropriate follow-up questions. LLM integration fully functional, intent analysis working correctly, UI actions appropriate for each intent type. Backend service was temporarily down due to missing main.py file but has been fixed and all tests now pass 100%."
