The previous AI engineer successfully evolved Travello.ai into a multi-agent, LLM-driven conversational travel planner. Initial work involved UI/UX overhauls, integrating dynamic content, and establishing a robust backend architecture. A significant phase focused on integrating LLM capabilities into all downstream agents (, , , , ) to move beyond mock data, ensuring contextual and accurate responses. The engineer meticulously debugged persistent backend API timeouts and frontend rendering issues, fixing critical communication gaps. Recent efforts focused on refining agent interactions, ensuring correct JSON payload formatting, and addressing complex context loss scenarios in multi-turn conversations. The work involved deep dives into , , and  to fix routing, intent detection, and session management. Frontend updates to handle new UI action types were initiated.

<product_requirements>
Travello.ai aims to be a conversational travel planner with a split-screen desktop UI, animated chatbot, rich inline cards, contextual question chips, and an interactive Leaflet map. The application, styled in a green-orange theme, focuses on Indian adventure tourism with real tour/activity details. Key user requirements include: dynamic question suggestions; Plan a Trip buttons on cards; a complete UI/UX overhaul mirroring Mindtrip.ai (new colors, modals, smaller chips, enhanced itinerary, swipeable image galleries); an interactive Leaflet map; a multi-agent chatbot architecture (Conversation Manager, Slot Agents, Planner, Retrieval, Accommodation, Validator, UX Agents) with a strict JSON  schema for intelligent, slot-filling, and itinerary generation. The bot must leverage LLMs and pre-trained data for personalized, API-driven recommendations, providing full LLM-generated itineraries from personalized forms (dates, destination, budget, travelers), and ensuring all clickable items function within the new flow.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a complex set of issues across both backend and frontend. On the backend, significant progress was made on fixing context loss. Specifically, the  was refined to correctly leverage existing session context for queries like hotels and to prevent LLM destination extraction from overriding known destinations, which was causing repeated clarification questions. The  was also updated to pass  effectively to the . This ensures that multi-turn conversations maintain context, allowing users to ask hotels after discussing a destination like Goa and receive relevant recommendations.

On the frontend, the engineer began implementing handlers for new UI action types, specifically , , and  within . This is critical for properly rendering LLM-generated itineraries, trip planning forms, and follow-up questions, which were previously not appearing in the UI. Missing state variables required for these new UI components were identified and added. The Plan Trip button functionality, which should initiate a trip planning flow with the selected destination, was also under review, with the  function already existing. The current work involved tracing how question chips are rendered, indicating a focus on comprehensive UI action handling to ensure all backend-generated UI elements are correctly displayed to the user.
